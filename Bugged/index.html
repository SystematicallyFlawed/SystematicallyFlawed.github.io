<h2>Is Bugged abandoned?</h2>
<p>For now, yes. I do plan to come back to finish or at the very least update Bugged, however that may be a long time.</p>
<p>With the way things are going, it may be more likely that I just fully remake Bugged in 3D.</p>
<h2>Why was Bugged abandoned?</h2>
<p>I was mainly working on Bugged while learning Python, and then I got Python certified, and moved on from it.</p>
<p>The other main reason is that I was at a point where my main to-do list was just "Make scene for this stage" so it got quite annoying. This is the main reason Bugged has so many random things, as I just wanted something to do that wasn't making stages over and over again.</p>
<h2>What is Bugged?</h2>
<p>Bugged is my very first attempt at making a 2D platformer.</p>
<h2>What language is Bugged made in?</h2>
<p>Bugged is made in Python.</p>
<h2>What libraries does Bugged use?</h2>
<p>Pygame, Sys, Random, Tkinter, and Time.</p>
<h2>Does Bugged have a story?</h2>
<p>Yesn't.</p>
<p>Bugged kind of has a story, in a way. There are certain conclusions you can come to based upon the enviroment and singular friendly NPC. However there isn't currently a fully thought out story. It's more like occasional bits of lore that just kind of exist. A full story or atleast a more thought out story will probably come later on when I return to working on or remake Bugged.</p>
<h2>Why does Bugged look so bad?</h2>
<p>I never claimed to be an artist, ok? Bugged, aswell as being my first actual game, has my first attempts at actually making pixel art.</p>
<h2>Why is Bugged so hard?</h2>
<p>Skill issue.</p>
<h2>Where can Bugged be downloaded?</h2>
<p>Bugged can be found <a class= "bugged-link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SystematicallyFlawed/Python-Games/tree/main/Bugged">here on my github</a>.</p>
